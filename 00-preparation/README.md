# 00-preparation

This folder contains notes and setup instructions for my bootcamp:

- Installed Python, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- Configured Git and GitHub for version control  
- Learned how to create repositories and commit changes  
- Set up folder structure for documentation  

These notes help me track my setup and ensure my environment is ready for coding.
